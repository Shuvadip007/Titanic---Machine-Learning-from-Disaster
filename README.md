# Titanic---Machine-Learning-from-Disaster

This repository contains my solution to the Titanic Machine Learning competition on Kaggle. The goal of the competition is to build a predictive model to determine which passengers survived the Titanic shipwreck.

## Project Overview
The sinking of the Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history. On April 15, 1912, the RMS Titanic sank after hitting an iceberg, resulting in the loss of 1502 lives out of 2224 passengers and crew.

The challenge is to predict the survival of passengers based on features such as name, age, gender, ticket class, etc.

## Dataset
The dataset consists of two CSV files:

- **train.csv**: Contains passenger details and whether they survived or not (used for training the model).
- **test.csv**: Contains similar details but without survival information (used for predictions).

### Features
- **PassengerId**: Unique ID for each passenger.
- **Survived**: Survival status (0 = No, 1 = Yes) [Only in train.csv].
- **Pclass**: Ticket class (1st, 2nd, or 3rd class).
- **Name**: Passenger’s name.
- **Sex**: Passenger’s gender.
- **Age**: Passenger’s age.
- **SibSp**: Number of siblings/spouses aboard.
- **Parch**: Number of parents/children aboard.
- **Ticket**: Ticket number.
- **Fare**: Fare paid for the ticket.
- **Cabin**: Cabin number (if available).
- **Embarked**: Port of embarkation (C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton).

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
To run this project, you need:
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook (optional)
- Kaggle API (optional)

### Installation
1. Clone this repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/Shuvadip007/titanic-ml.git
   cd titanic-ml
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the Jupyter notebook:
   ```sh
   jupyter notebook
   ```

## Model Approach
- Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature Engineering
- Model Selection and Training
- Model Evaluation and Optimization
- Submission to Kaggle

## Results
The trained model is evaluated based on accuracy, and the submission file is ranked on the Kaggle leaderboard.
